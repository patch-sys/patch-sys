## Who Am I?

Hey there! I'm a **24-year-old** Software Engineer with a passion for coding, continuous learning, and exploring new technologies. I enjoy solving complex problems and building efficient, scalable solutions.

- **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, and a growing collection of "hello world" programs in other languages.
- **Frameworks:** Vue, React, Angular - because variety is the spice of life.
- **Hobbies:** When I'm not writing code, you might find me traveling to new places, trying out the local cuisine, or diving into a good book. I also dabble in creative hobbies like model building and learning new languages like Japanese.

## 🌍 Languages I Speak

- **German:** Native speaker.
- **English:** C1 level - Fluent and professional.
- **Japanese:** Currently learning - 頑張ってます!

## 🎯 Random Facts
- I write code like I build Gunpla: carefully and obsessively.
- My anime watchlist is longer than my TODO list (which is saying something).
- I’m convinced that the best debugging happens after a cup of coffee and an episode of *One Piece*.
